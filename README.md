## Impact of new Food Safety Rating System in King County
Performed exploratory data analysis on King County restaurant food inspection dataset (2006-2019), built an interactive dashboard visualizing performance of restaurants across major cities using R(Shiny), and concluded that Seattle is the only city with restaurants getting consistently better with new rating system
