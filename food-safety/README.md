# Impact of new Food Safety Rating System in King County
The goal of this project was to assess the impact of introduction of new food safety rating system on restaurants' performance. I analyzed all the cities within King County and created a dashboard to showcase the rating system impact in major cities within King County.  

Here are 2 screenshots showcasing the impact of new rating system in all of Seattle restaurants: 
* First shows all the resutaurants with at least 1 critical violation, in both older & newer system.
* Second shows all the restaurants which were closed at least once due to inspection results.
