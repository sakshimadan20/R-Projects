# Impact of new Food Safety Rating System in King County
The goal of this project was to assess the impact of introduction of new food safety rating system by King County in January 2017. I analyzed all the restaurants across five major cities - Seattle, Bellevue, Kent, Renton and Federal Way and created a dashboard visualizing their performance with the new rating system. 

Here are 2 screenshots showcasing the impact of new rating system in all of Seattle restaurants: 
* First shows all the restaurants with at least 1 critical violation, in both older & newer system.
* Second shows all the restaurants which were closed at least once due to inspection results.
