# Effectiveness of advertising and promotions for General Mills
The goal of the project was to analyze the effectiveness of advertising and promotions for General Mills. To accomplish that, I extracted a sample data with 21,850 observations on weekly sales of cereals from several stores. It was interesting to find effectiveness of advertising and promotions on sales between different producers. We found that General Mills perform better with promotions and medium-sized ads whereas the biggest competitor, Kelloggs with promotions and small-sized ads. Also, all cereal brands under General Mills are following the same pattern except Cheerios, which surprisingly performs better without any kind of promotions or ads.
