# Determine the compensation for Ontario, Canada residents due to lost area from road widening project
The goal of the project was to estimate the compensation to be awarded to residents in Ontario due to lost area of house from road widening project. I was provided with 104 house sale data from 1998 to 2003. Using multiple regression in R, I formulated an econometric model determining the price of a house based on features like lot area, distance from the curb, traffic count etc. The model was assessed using R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values. I also performed t-tests on the estimated coefficients. Using the model, I estimated the compensation to be given to the residents for the loss.
