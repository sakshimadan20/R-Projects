# Base EDA Step 2: Uni-variate graphical EDA

## Quantitative Variables

```{r message = FALSE}

# Uni-variate for price_1000

grid.arrange(

  ggplot(data = house_sale, mapping = aes(x = price_1000)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 10) + 
    xlim(0, 2000) +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x = "Price in thousands", y = ""),
  
  ggplot(data = house_sale, mapping = aes(x = 1)) +
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = price_1000)) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x = " ", y = "Price in thousands") +
    ylim(0, 2000)
  
)

```
  
  + Price is not evenly distributed , there is a huge difference between minimum and maximum
  + There is more demand for cheaper houses $500K
  + for Price > 1000K - means they are high prices, may be some particular zipcodes have those type of communities?

```{r message = FALSE}

# Uni-variate for sqft_living

grid.arrange(

  ggplot(data = house_sale, mapping = aes(x = sqft_living)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 10) + 
    xlim(0, 5000) +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x = "Living space in sqft", y = ""),
  
  ggplot(data = house_sale, mapping = aes(x = 1)) +
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = sqft_living)) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x = " ", y = "Living space in sqft") +
    ylim(0, 5000)
  
)

```
  
  + Sqft_living is similar to the price distribution which means: Houses < $500K are sold the most and Living 
  Space < 1900Sqft are sold the most 2) House sale with Price > $500K starts to decrease and houses with 
  living space > 1900Sqft starts to decrease
  + Is this trend same across all types of bedrooms/bathrooms/floors/grade/condition/zipcodes?
  + Mean is almost equal to median

```{r message = FALSE}

# Uni-variate for sqft_lot

grid.arrange(

  ggplot(data = house_sale, mapping = aes(x = sqft_lot)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +

    coord_flip() +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x = " ", y = "Lot in sqft") +
    ylim(0, 20000)

  + Maximum number of houses sold are with bedrooms 3 and 4
  + Maximum number os houses sold are with bathrooms 2.5
  + Maximum number os houses sold are with 1 floor
  + We don't have much data for houses with view
  + Grade 7 and Condition 3 houses are sold the most
  + Does this pattern of different variables remain the same for high priced houses > 1000k?

## Categorical Variables

```{r message = FALSE}

# Uni-variate for waterfront

  ggplot(data = house_sale, mapping = aes(x=waterfront)) +
    geom_bar() +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x = "Waterfront", y = "" )


```
  
  + As before, we don't have a lot of data for waterfront houses, we may not consider this variable later

```{r message = FALSE}

# Uni-variate for zip_code

  ggplot(data = house_sale, mapping = aes(x=zip_code)) +
    geom_bar() +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x = "ZipCode", y = "")


```

  \
  + Houses are sold within a large number of zipcodes
  + We are curious about high prices communities, which we are going to dig deep in
  
# Base EDA Step 3: Multi-variate non - graphical 

## Categorical

```{r message = FALSE}


house_sale %>% tabyl(zip_code, waterfront) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col"))

```

  + The houses with waterfronts are just 0.75% of the total houses, hence we may neglect the waterfront data
  
##  Quantitative

```{r message = FALSE}

house_sale_filter <- house_sale[,c(14,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11)]
house_sale_filter_cor <- cor(house_sale_filter)
house_sale_filter_cor


``` 

  + The strong correlation between price_1000 and sqft_living is quite visible here
  + Is this correlation of price_1000 and sqft_living remains true amongst other strongly correlated variables bathrooms & grade?
  
#  Base EDA Step 4: Multi-variate graphical 

## Categorical

```{r}

target_zip <- c(98103,98038,98115,98052,98117,98042)

house_sale %>% 
  filter(zip_code %in% target_zip) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = zip_code, y = 1, fill = waterfront))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Zipcode", y ="")

```



  + We have taken the top 6 zipcodes here and found out the same thing is waterfront houses are negligible as compared to others
  
## Quantitative

```{r message = FALSE}

#Correlation plot between all quantitative variables

house_sale_filter <- house_sale[, c(14, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)]
corrplot(house_sale_filter_cor)

```

  + Shows a strong correlation between variables Price_1000 & Sqft_Living. Does the relation hold strong amongst other strong variables bathrooms & grade?

```{r message = FALSE}

# Multivariate between price & sqft_living 
house_sale %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = sqft_living, y = price_1000)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Sqft Living", y = "Sqft Price")

# Multivariate between price & bathrooms

  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bathrooms, y = price_1000)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Bathrooms", y = "Price")

# Multivariate between price and grades

  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_classic() +

  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +

```

  + Here we have taken 4 variables which we found as correlated as above
  + A strong correlation between all 4 variables looking at the line
  + We are going to dig deep into this

## Categorical and Quantitative

```{r message = FALSE}
# Multivariate between zipcodes and quantitative variables

grid.arrange(

  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Condition across Zipcodes", y = "") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


)

house_sale %>%
  filter(zip_code %in% target_zip) %>%

  geom_histogram(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ zip_code) +
  labs(x = "Price distirbution across Zipcodes", y = "")
 

```

  + We have considered top 6 zipcodes (which have highest sale)
  
  + Shows zipcodes have similar patterns for some variables (Bedrooms, Grades, Conditions), not all
  
  + Looks like the price distribution is not even among them
  
  + We also want to find out high prices communites, price_1000 > 1000k and do this analysis for them

  + We found out that 98004, 98006, 98040 and 98112 fall among the 4 top high priced zipcodes
  + Did not consider year_renovated & view because of lesser data as compared to others, but we compared all the variables 
    amongst high valued zipcodes and concluded:
  + We see that high priced houses have more of 4 bedrooms
  + We also see that they have more of grade 8 houses 
  + Also, definitely they have bigger sqft_livng and sqft_lot

# Summary

  + We need more data to analyze Waterfront Houses, Views, Year Renovated
  + Strong correlation between price and sq_ft which holds true amongst bathrooms and grades
  + Price Distribution varies for zipcodes
  + Zip Code 98004 98006, 98040, 98112 fall amongst high priced neighborhood 
  + FOr high priced houses, we found that people prefer 4 bedroom and grade 8 houses as compared to 3 and 7 respectively.
